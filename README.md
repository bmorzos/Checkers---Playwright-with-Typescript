Playwright Checkers Test Automation ♟️This repository contains an end-to-end automated test suite for the web-based Checkers game on gamesforthebrain.com.It is built with Playwright and TypeScript. It demonstrates a robust Page Object Model (POM) implementation designed to test complex UI interactions and game logic.🚀 Technology StackPlaywright: For browser automation and testing.TypeScript: For type safety and modern JavaScript features.Node.js: As the runtime environment.✨ Key FeaturesThis framework is built to be resilient and efficient.Page Object Model (POM): All logic for interacting with the checkers page is encapsulated in pages/CheckersPage.ts. This makes tests clean and readable.Custom Board Setup: A powerful setBoard() function directly manipulates the game's internal JavaScript variables. This allows tests to create any board scenario instantly, bypassing slow UI setup.Visual State Parsing: The getVisualBoardState() method reads the DOM (specifically, the src attribute of each piece's <img> tag) to determine the true visual state of the board. This is crucial for verifying "selected" states, which don't exist in the game's data layer.Comprehensive Test Suites: Tests are organized by feature:BasicMoves.spec.ts: Validates simple piece movement and deselection.Kinging.spec.ts: Validates all logic related to a piece becoming a king and a king's movement.IllegalMoves.spec.ts: Confirms that the game logic correctly prevents invalid moves.🏁 Getting Started1. PrerequisitesMake sure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) installed on your machine.2.

🧪 Running TestsHere are the most common ways to run the test suite.Run All TestsTo execute the entire test suite in headless mode (no browser window shown):npx playwright test
Run in Headed ModeTo watch the tests execute in a live browser window:npx playwright test --headed
Run a Specific FileTo run all tests within a single file (e.g., Kinging.spec.ts):npx playwright test tests/Kinging.spec.ts
Open the UI Test RunnerTo open Playwright's interactive test runner, which is great for debugging:npx playwright test --ui
